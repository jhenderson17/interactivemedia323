		Freedom will not come
		<br>
		<br>
		Today, this year
		<br>
		Nor ever
		<br>
		<br>
		Through compromise and fear.
		<br>
		<br>
		I have as much right
		<br>
		As the other fellow has
		<br>
		<br>
		To stand
		<br>
		On my two feet
		<br>
		<br>
		And own the land.
		<br>
		<br>
		I tire so of hearing people say,
		<br>
		Let things take their course.
		<br>
		<br>
		Tomorrow is another day.
		<br>
		<br>
		I do not need my freedom when I’m dead.
		<br>
		I cannot live on tomorrow’s bread.
		<br>
		<br>
		Freedom is a strong seed
		<br>
		Planted in a great need.
		<br>
		<br>
		I live here, too.
		<br>
		<br>
		I want my freedom
		<br>
		Just as you.  
		<br>
