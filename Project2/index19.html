	<p>I cannot live on tomorrow’s bread.
And own the land.
Tomorrow is another day.
Freedom will not come
As the other fellow has
Freedom is a strong seed
Planted in a great need.

I live here, too.
Through compromise and fear.
I tire so of hearing people say,
On my two feet
I want my freedom
To stand

Just as you.  
I have as much right
I do not need my freedom when I’m dead.
Nor ever
Let things take their course.
