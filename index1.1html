	<p>
		Freedom will not come
		Today, this year
		Nor ever
		Through compromise and fear.
		<br>
		I have as much right
		As the other fellow has
		To stand
		On my two feet
		And own the land.
		<br>
		I tire so of hearing people say,
		Let things take their course.
		Tomorrow is another day.
		I do not need my freedom when I’m dead.
		I cannot live on tomorrow’s bread.
		<br>
		Freedom is a strong seed
		Planted in a great need.
		I live here, too.
		I want my freedom
		Just as you.
